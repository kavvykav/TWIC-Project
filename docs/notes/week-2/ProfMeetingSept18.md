**Sept 18 Meeting:**

Access control
4 Types
KNOW pin, 
HAVE card, 
ARE biometric, 
DO signature 
(are/do = static or dynamic)

Multi Factor is two Types of Access Control
Static Bio is Fingerprint, Pin is associated with the person already. Pin serves no purpose. 

Use Characteristics
WHO is using this system, and what constraints do they have, do make types of access control.
Nature of users of Maritime Workers is that you may not have all cellular access, or wifi access wherever you are. 
Look for alternatives to this

Different levels of security, more types, for higher confidential areas
Biometric things tend to be cumbersome. Not feasible for basic area access

Two types of people
Stationary
Mobile

Some people stay in one set of ports, while others move between them. 

To store less data, reg only when they are likely to access the port
But this is cumbersome. Easier and faster but more data storage to just add everyone, and delineate perms locally

Note the non functional requirements. Rank them. Note that some sacrifices must be made on each. 

No access control on the ship itself after it has left the port. 
Look at an arial view of a port to see what kinds of things it has as security.

Draw out the ports and such.

Database must eventually be scalable. For now text file works
Make sure there are appropriate wrappers so its easy to swap out database type.

Summary:
Rethink ways of authentication based on the constraints of the individual who would use this
Centralized vs Distributed
**Keep track of alternatives, and justify decisions**
Get clear the high level design to order things
