# October 2nd 2024 Capstone Meeting

## Points from Jason

### Roles

- Define more hierarchy in roles (local worker should be fleshed out more) possibly a tree-like structure
- Bring up questions like conflict zones
- Do more research into ports and personnel at ports
- Roles may overlap (Possibly also define roles on a per port basis)
- Possibly inherit roles
- Think of it like unix groups

### Requirements

- Group requirements that are related (2fa with fingerprint and card)
- Don't prescribe solutions, lay out problems that need solving
- Add dictionary/glossary for terms
- Find the root reason for what we are doing (why)
- Reword any requirements that are too technical/prescribing methods
- Be specific with terms that can be ambiguous
- Use standards for stuff like date/time

### Use Cases

- Might want to go more in depth on what stuff means
- Act out sequences to find any issues (scan fingerprint -> allowed in)
- Break down sequences so they're easily digestible
- Add use cases (possibly deregister, forbid, block)
- Categorize and group use cases (management, workers, etc)
