## Prototypes 

This folder contains early development prototypes and ideas to explore certain aspects of the project. These prototypes are intended as proof-of-concepts and learning opportunities for the team, and are not representative of the final implementation of the project

Within each subfolder should be a description of each prototypes purpose, status, and instructions on operation.
