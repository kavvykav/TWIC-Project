# Thread and Concurency in Rust

## Purpose
The purpose of this prototype is to explore the capabilities of rust threads and concurency. This is to see if the langauge will be a good fit for the final
design while also giving members expierence in a language that they are unfamiliar with. To give the prototype some relavence to the project it implements
the 'Authenticating a User At Checkpoint' design flow diagram.

## Status
Currently we have communication between two threads, sending and reciving working. It implements the most barebones implementation of the design flow diagram.

#### Future Work
* Clean-up code
* Add the ability for fingerprint error
* Add more error handling
* Add the ability for fingerprint and ID data to be on a database
* Add the ability to communicate with database
* Implement enroll new user flow diagram


## Instructions
Download threads.exe and run program.
